  Written by Paul Carpenter, PC Services <sales@pcserviceselectronics.co.uk>
  Created September 2014
  Updated January 2016 - Paul Carpenter - add tested on Due and tidy ups for V1.5 Library Management
    January 2020   Fix typos, correct keyboard reset status improve library.properties 
		   and additional platform handling and some documentation
    March 2020  Add SAMD1 as recognised support as has been tested by user
                Improve different architecture handling

  IMPORTANT WARNING
 
    If using a DUE or similar board with 3V3 I/O you MUST put a level translator 
    like a Texas Instruments TXS0102 or FET circuit as the signals are 
    Bi-directional (signals transmitted from both ends on same wire).
 
    Failure to do so may damage your Arduino Due or similar board.

  Test History
    September 2014 Uno and Mega 2560 September 2014 using Arduino V1.6.0
    January 2016   Uno, Mega 2560 and Due using Arduino 1.6.7 and Due Board 
                    Manager V1.6.6
                    

  Assumption - Only ONE keyboard added to one Arduino
             - No stream support

  This is for a LATIN style keyboard using Scan code set 2. See various
  websites on what different scan code sets use. Scan Code Set 2 is the
  default scan code set for PS2 keyboards on power up.

  Fully featured PS2 keyboard library to provide
    All keys as a keycode (A-Z and 0-9 as ASCII equivalents)
    All function and movement keys supported even multi-lingual
    Parity checking of data sent/received on receive request keyboard resend
    Resends data when needed handles keyboard protocol for RESEND and ECHO
    Functions for get and set of
        Scancode set in use READ only
        LED and LOCK control
        ReadID
        Reset keyboard
        Send ECHO
        Handles NUM, _CAPS and SCROLL lock keys to LEDs
        Handles NUM/SCROLL internally

  Returns an uint16_t containing
        Make/Break status
        CAPS status
        SHIFT, CTRL, ALT, ALT GR, GUI keys
        Flag for function key not a displayable/printable character
        8 bit key code

    Code Ranges(bottom byte of uint16_t) see PS2KeyAdvanced.h for details
        0       invalid/error
        1-1F    Functions (_CAPS, _SHIFT, _ALT, Enter, DEL... )
        1A-1F   Functions with ASCII control code
                    (DEL, BS, TAB, ESC, ENTER, SPACE)
        20-60   Printable characters noting
                    0-9 = 0x30 to 0x39 as ASCII
                    A to Z = 0x41 to 0x5A as upper case ASCII type codes
                    8B Extra European key
        61-A0   Function keys and other special keys (plus F2 and F1 less 8B)
                    61-78 F1 to F24
                    79-8A Multimedia
                    8C-8E ACPI power
                    91-A0 and F2 and F1 - Special multilingual
        A8-FF   Keyboard communications commands (note F2 and F1 are special
                codes for special multi-lingual keyboards)

    By using these ranges it is possible to perform detection of any key and do
    easy translation to ASCII/UTF-8 avoiding keys that do not have a valid code.

    Top Byte is 8 bits denoting as follows with defines for bit code

        Define name bit     description
        PS2_BREAK   15      1 = Break key code
                   (MSB)    0 = Make Key code
        PS2_SHIFT   14      1 = Shift key pressed as well (either side)
                            0 = NO shift key
        PS2_CTRL    13      1 = Ctrl key pressed as well (either side)
                            0 = NO Ctrl key
        PS2_CAPS    12      1 = Caps Lock ON
                            0 = Caps lock OFF
        PS2_ALT     11      1 = Left Alt key pressed as well
                            0 = NO Left Alt key
        PS2_ALT_GR  10      1 = Right Alt (Alt GR) key pressed as well
                            0 = NO Right Alt key
        PS2_GUI      9      1 = GUI key pressed as well (either)
                            0 = NO GUI key
        PS2_FUNCTION 8      1 = FUNCTION key non-printable character (plus space, tab, enter)
                            0 = standard character key

  Error Codes
     Most functions return 0 or 0xFFFF as error, other codes to note and
     handle appropriately value in bottom byte
        0xAA   keyboard has reset and passed power up tests
               will happen if keyboard plugged in after code start
        0xFC   Keyboard General error or power up fail

  It is responsibility of your programme to deal with converting special cases
  like <_CTRL>+<ENTER> sends a special code to something else. A better method
  is to use PS2KeyMap library and add your own table to that library. If you
  wish to do that make a NEW library called SOMETHING different NOT a variant
  or revision of this one, as you are changing base functionality

  See PS2KeyCode.h for codes from the keyboard this library uses to decode.
  (may disappear in updates do not rely on this file or definitions)

  See PS2KeyAvanced.h for returned definitions of Keys and accessible
  definitions

  See PS2KeyMap.h for tables currently supported

  To get the key as ASCII/UTF-8 single byte character conversion requires use
  of PS2KeyMap library AS WELL.
